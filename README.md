# Generative AI for E-commerce Image Generation

## Project Overview
This project leverages generative AI models, such as GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), to produce high-quality product images tailored for e-commerce platforms. The system enhances product listings by creating diverse and realistic images, improving customer engagement and sales.

## Use Cases

### 1. Product Image Augmentation
**Problem Statement:**
E-commerce platforms often lack diverse and high-quality images for their product listings, impacting sales and customer trust.

**Solution:**
Utilize a generative adversarial network (GAN) to augment existing product images, generating multiple high-resolution images from different angles and in various settings to enhance product listings.

### 2. Virtual Try-On Experiences
**Problem Statement:**
Customers are hesitant to purchase apparel and accessories online due to uncertainty about fit and appearance.

**Solution:**
Implement a virtual try-on feature using generative AI that allows customers to visualize products on themselves in real-time, increasing conversion rates and reducing return rates.
